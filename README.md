# A Data Science Refresh

Following the method described in [my blog post here](http://rachellaurenwoods.com/an-agile-method-to-refreshing-data-science-knowledge/), I spent a few months systematically reviewing and learning data science concepts. 

The learning path I took is documented here so that you may use it if either: 
1. You are wanting to **learn the skills** related to data science
2. You are wanting to **refresh your skills** for interviewing, new job, or other purposes

## Topics Covered
*I do also recommend covering them in the order listed:*
1. Statistics
2. Exploratory Analysis
3. Visualization
4. Predictive Analytics
5. Deep Machine Learning & AI

## How to Use This 
My goal is *not* to tell you how to learn key data science concepts. My goal is to share the resources I used in refreshing my skills.

In my opinion, the best way to use this repo is as a starting point (take what you like, ignore what you don't, supplement what you think is missing, etc). 

**If you have other resources you'd like to recommend, please issue a pull request, I'd love to add contributors!**
